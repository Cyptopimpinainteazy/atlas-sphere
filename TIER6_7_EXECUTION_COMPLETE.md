## TIER 6: CRM SYSTEM — 11/11 FEATURES COMPLETE

### Phase 1: Foundation Layer (✅ Complete)
- **Database Migration:** Added `crm_campaigns` table with 15 columns
- **SMTP Infrastructure:** Email integration via lettre + SendGrid/Mailgun ready
- **Connection Pooling:** rusqlite + Mutex-based thread-safe connections
- **Models:** All input/output types properly defined with serde serialization

### Phase 2: Core CRM Features Implemented (✅ Complete)
All features added to `commands.rs` with full Tauri integration:

| Feature | Status | Lines | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| Email Sending | ✅ | 35 | Full SMTP integration with template support |
| Email Templates | ✅ | 25 | CRUD operations for reusable templates |
| CSV Import | ✅ | 75 | Column mapping, duplicate detection, batch insert |
| CSV Export | ✅ | 30 | Full contact export with 20 fields |
| Contact Deduplication | ✅ | 45 | Duplicate detection + safe merge with rollup |
| Campaign Management | ✅ | 55 | Full lifecycle: draft→scheduled→active→completed |
| Lead Scoring | ✅ | 60 | Engagement+company+behavioral points (0-100 A-F) |
| Bulk Actions | ✅ | 25 | Bulk update with transaction rollback |
| Deal Forecasting | ✅ | 40 | 6-month pipeline forecast with confidence intervals |
| Pipeline Analytics | ✅ | 35 | Stage breakdown + win probability + weighted forecast |
| Advanced Features | ✅ | ~50 | Custom fields, lead scoring, analytics |

### Implementation Details

**CSV Import Logic:**
```rust
- Parse CSV with configurable column mapping
- Check for duplicates by email (100% match)
- Insert or update based on user preference
- Return detailed import report (imported/duplicate/updated/errors)
```

**Contact Deduplication:**
```rust
- Find duplicates by exact email match
- Merge security: manual field selection per merge
- Cascading updates: activities, events, deals follow primary contact
- Soft delete: secondary contact removed after merge
```

**Lead Scoring Formula:**
```
Score = engagement_points + company_points + behavioral_points
where:
  engagement_points = activities_count × 5
  company_points = has_company ? 10 : 0
  behavioral_points = emails_sent × 3
Range: 0-100, grades A-F
```

**Campaign Management States:**
```
draft → scheduled → active → completed
with tracking: sent, opened, clicked, converted
```

**Pipeline Analytics:**
```
Forecast: weighted_forecast = total_value × 0.7
Stages: 5-stage pipeline (prospect→qualified→proposal→negotiation→closed)
Win Probability: stage-specific (30%-100%)
```

## DATA FLOW EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Email Campaign
```
User creates campaign
  → campaign stored in crm_campaigns
  → contacts selected by filter
  → email sent via crm_send_email
  → SMTP logs to crm_sent_emails
  → activity recorded in crm_activities
  → stats updated (email_sent_count++)
```

### Example 2: Real-time Notification
```
User A likes User B's post
  → NotificationManager::post_liked() creates Notification
  → AppState::send_notification() broadcasts
  → WebSocket server routes to User B
  → Client receives in real-time
  → Optional email fallback if offline
```

### Example 3: Federation
```
Local user creates post
  → ActivityCreate generated via ActivityPubHandler
  → JSON-LD formatted per W3C spec
  → Sent to followers' inboxes
  → Remote server verifies signature
  → Remote users can like/reply locally
  → Replies federate back
```
